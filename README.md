My PhD thesis, on the topic of plasmons.

Plasmon: under certain conditions, light waves can couple with electrons at the metal/air interface. This light/electron quasiparticle is called a [plasmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon).

Subject of thesis: the study of both travelling and stationary plasmons on a structured metal surface.

Location of work: The [nanophotonics](https://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk/) lab led by [J.J. Baumberg](https://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk/people/jjb12).
